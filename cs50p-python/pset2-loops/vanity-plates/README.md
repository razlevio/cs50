In Massachusetts, home to Harvard University, it’s possible to [request a vanity license plate](https://www.mass.gov/how-to/request-a-vanity-license-plate) for your car, with your choice of letters and numbers instead of random ones. Among the requirements, though, are:

- “All vanity plates must start with at least two letters.”
- “… vanity plates may contain a maximum of 6 characters (letters or numbers) and a minimum of 2 characters.”
- “Numbers cannot be used in the middle of a plate; they must come at the end. For example, AAA222 would be an acceptable … vanity plate; AAA22A would not be acceptable. The first number used cannot be a ‘0’.”
- “No periods, spaces, or punctuation marks are allowed.”

In `plates.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for a vanity plate and then output `Valid` if meets all of the requirements or `Invalid` if it does not. Assume that any letters in the user’s input will be uppercase. Structure your program per the below, wherein `is_valid` returns `True` if `s` meets all requirements and `False` if it does not. Assume that `s` will be a `str`. You’re welcome to implement additional functions for `is_valid` to call (e.g., one function per requirement).

```
def main():
    plate = input("Plate: ")
    if is_valid(plate):
        print("Valid")
    else:
        print("Invalid")


def is_valid(s):
    ...


main()
```
