The U.S. Food & Drug Adminstration (FDA) offers [downloadable/printable posters](https://www.fda.gov/food/food-labeling-nutrition/nutrition-information-raw-fruits-vegetables-and-fish) that “show nutrition information for the 20 most frequently consumed raw fruits … in the United States. Retail stores are welcome to download the posters, print, display and/or distribute them to consumers in close proximity to the relevant foods in the stores.”

In a file called `nutrition.py`, implement a program that prompts consumers users to input a fruit (case-insensitively) and then outputs the number of calories in one portion of that fruit, per the [FDA’s poster for fruits](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/2/nutrition/Nutrition-Information-for-Raw-Fruits---small-PDF-Poster.pdf), which is also [available as text](https://www.fda.gov/food/food-labeling-nutrition/raw-fruits-poster-text-version-accessible-version). Capitalization aside, assume that users will input fruits exactly as written in the poster (e.g., `strawberries`, not `strawberry`). Ignore any input that isn’t a fruit.
