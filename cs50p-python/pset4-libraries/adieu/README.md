# [Adieu, Adieu](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/4/adieu/#adieu-adieu)

In [The Sound of Music](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sound_of_Music_(film)>), there’s a song sung largely in English, [So Long, Farewell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy9_lfjQopU), with these [lyrics](https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/3998488/Julie+Andrews/So+Long%2C+Farewell), wherein “adieu” means “goodbye” in French:

> Adieu, adieu, to yieu and yieu and yieu

Of course, the line isn’t grammatically correct, since it would typically be written (with an [Oxford comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma)) as:

> Adieu, adieu, to yieu, yieu, and yieu

To be fair, “yieu” isn’t even a word; it just rhymes with “you”!

In a file called `adieu.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for names, one per line, until the user inputs control-d. Assume that the user will input at least one name. Then bid adieu to those names, separating two names with one `and`, three names with two commas and one `and`, and n names with n−1 commas and one `and`, as in the below:

> Adieu, adieu, to Liesl  
> Adieu, adieu, to Liesl and Friedrich  
> Adieu, adieu, to Liesl, Friedrich, and Louisa  
> Adieu, adieu, to Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, and Kurt  
> Adieu, adieu, to Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, and Brigitta  
> Adieu, adieu, to Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, Brigitta, and Marta  
> Adieu, adieu, to Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, Brigitta, Marta, and Gretl
